### Imperial ###

Imperial is a project made as a sample project for an 8 hour Hackathon at BrainStation. This project was a collaboration between myself and Jess Hilliam and was an attempt to recreate the 'Indeed' website as it would exist in the Star Wars Galaxy. Please note that the project is meant as a parody and any likeness to branding is used as a fictional example.

The requirements of the Hackathon were to create a project to practice Git Flow with teammates, the project itself wasn't limited in topic, but limited to the following tech stack:

- Node
- Express
- React
- External APIs
- SCSS

Working within the coding hour restrictions meant that we limited the scope to a singular search page that renders some example tiles on click. If you'd like to run this project feel free to install via `npm i` on both the server and client side, once installed the server can be started via `node server.js` and the client can be started via `npm start`.

Hope you enjoyed this sample project!
